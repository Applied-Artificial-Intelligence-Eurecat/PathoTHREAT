Basándonos en los resultados de PathoTHREAT se recomienda hacer una simulación con PathoINVEST para modelar la extensión de la contaminación desde la posible fuente contaminación detectada con PathoREPORT. Adicionalmente se recomienda a través de pathoINVEST y con la ayuda de los operadores de la red evaluar la magnitud del impacto y decidir el número de muestras a analizar para conocer la contaminación real. Una vez seleccionados los puntos de muestreo de la red y el número de muestras a analizar, realizar dichos análisis para comprobar la extensión de la contaminación. Este muestreo debe realizarse con los equipos de protección individual necesarios para evitar contaminaciones, representatividad de la muestra y evitar contacto con la persona que realice estos análisis. Las herramientas de muestreo recomendadas PathoTeSTICK inmediata en las zonas de mayor concentración esperada y BactCONTROL en zonas de menor contaminación tiempo estimado de respuesta 30min.. &nbsp. INGLES-ENGLISH. Based on the PathoTHREAT results it is recommended to run a simulation with PathoINVEST to model the extent of contamination from the possible contamination source detected with PathoREPORT. Additionally, through pathoINVEST and with the help of network operators, it is recommended to evaluate the magnitude of the impact and decide the number of samples to analyze to find out the real contamination. Once the sampling points of the network and the number of samples to be analyzed have been selected, carry out these analyzes to check the extent of the contamination. This sampling must be carried out with the necessary individual protection equipment to avoid contamination, representativeness of the sample and avoid contact with the person who performs these analyses. The recommended sampling tools are PathoTeSTICK immediate in areas with the highest expected concentration and BactCONTROL in areas with less contamination estimated response time 30min..
